## vocabulisty - collaborate on (latin) vocabulary lists

*Disclaimer: This was made in 2010 is in fact my very first PHP web app. It may contain serious security holes but used to work very well for my latin course consisting of ~15 people.*

### Facts
* vocabulisty is only available in german
* if you want to use it for any other purpose than german/latin vocabulary, you will have to make some changes to the code
* the input form provides a simple syntax for vowel accents and text formatting
* it includes a flashcard training tool
* lists can be exported for [granule](http://granule.sourceforge.net/), [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) and [Pauker](http://pauker.sourceforge.net/), all of which have mobile ports for either maemo, Android, iOS, palmOS or J2ME. My recommendation is Pauker.
* editing single words is possible though quite a hassle...
* IMO the most efficient software regarding the workload of feeding lists ;)
* it comes with 1599 german/latin word pairs (stolen from the adeo book, the e-lectio appendings and other sources) in 49 lists (SQL format, import into your MySQL db)
* this being PHP as well as my first web app implies ugly and inefficient code style
* it's licensed under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/). In fact I want anyone to steal it and say he's the author so my name will never again be mentioned in relation to this ugly piece of code.
